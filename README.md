Hello There, the following repository includes my first project following the Odin Project Foundation Course 

Here i practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired such as HTML Elements, Tags, List, Links & Images. 

In this project, I built a basic recipe website consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
