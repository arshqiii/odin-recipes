        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> 
            A cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with equal parts double espresso, steamed milk, and steamed milk foam on top. 
            Cream may be used instead of milk. It is typically smaller in volume than a latte, and has a thicker layer of microfoam. 
            Espresso is typically made with dark roast coffee and ground finely.

        <hr> 
        <ol>
            <li> Gather the ingredients. </li>
            <li> Place the water into the boiler of your espresso machine. </li>
            <li> Place the 2 tablespoons (2 shots) of ground coffee into the portafilter. </li>
            <li> Tamp (press) the coffee down using a tamper. Do this 2 to 3 times to make sure the grounds are packed tightly. </li>
            <li> Place the portafilter into your espresso machine's group head and lock it in place by turning it to the right. </li>
            <li> Place a demitasse cup or the glass carafe that came with your espresso machine under the group head and pull the shot for 23 to 30 seconds, or until 2 ounces of espresso is yielded. Typically, there is a lever, switch, or button to start this process. </li>
            <li> Once the shot is pulled, foam the milk. </li>
            <li> Place the milk into either a glass measuring cup or a small metal pitcher. </li>
            <li> Insert the steam wand into the container with the milk, just under the surface of the milk. </li>
            <li> Engage the steam wand on your espresso machine. (You may need to read your espresso machine's manual for this, as each espresso maker is a little different.) </li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the tip of the wand toward the side of the container. This will create a vortex with the milk. </li>
            <li> Move the container higher, lower, closer, then further so that the steam wand can incorporate the air into the milk, making the foam. The bubbles should get smaller and smaller as you do this. </li>
            <li> Once the milk has foamed to double its size, turn the steam wand off. </li>
            <li> Top the espresso with foamed milk right after foaming. When initially poured, cappuccino is only espresso and foam, but the liquid milk quickly settles out of the foam to create the (roughly) equal parts foam, steamed milk, and espresso for which cappuccino is known. </li>
